    """DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains,
    charged DNA base pairs and diradical transition states. It extends
    DFT (Density Functional Theory) which is a well established method
    for investigating electronic structure of many-body systems.

    Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a quantum mechanical method used
    to investigate the electronic structure (principally the ground state)
    of many-body systems, particularly atoms, molecules, and condensed
    phases. The main idea behind DFT is to describe the complex system
    of interacting particles (usually electrons) using the electron
    density, a function of spatial coordinates, rather than the many-body
    wavefunction.

    DeepMind 21 specifically address two long-standing problems with
    traditional functionals:

    1. The delocalization error: Most existing density functional
    approximations prefer electron densities that are unrealistically
    spread out over several atoms or molecules rather than being
    correctly localized around a single molecule or atom.

    2. Spin symmetry breaking: When describing the breaking of chemical
    bonds, existing functionals tend to unrealistically prefer configurations
    in which a fundamental symmetry known as spin symmetry is broken.

    These longstanding challenges are both related to how functionals
    behave when presented with a system that exhibits
    “fractional electron character.” By using a neural network to
    represent the functional and tailoring our training dataset to
    capture the fractional electron behaviour.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import torch
    >>> from deepchem.models.dft.dm21 import DM21
    >>> model = DM21()
    >>> input = torch.rand((100, 11))
    >>> output = model(input)
    >>> output.shape
    torch.Size([100, 3])
